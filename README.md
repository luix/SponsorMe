AndroidDevChallenge


**Bringing your idea to life in front of billions of eyes**

Got an idea? Whether it’s still a concept or ready for users, tell us how you could use Google’s help, and how it supports the mission of using machine learning to help people get something done. Join the #AndroidDeveloperChallenge topic on GitHub, and share your idea as a repository under this topic. Don’t forget to come back here and officially submit your concept.

We’ll pick 10 concepts and provide expertise and guidance to those developers to help in their plans to bring their ideas to fruition. And once the app is ready, we’ll help showcase it in front of the billions of users on Google Play, through a collection and more. Here’s what those 10 developers will get:

**Expertise and development support bootcamp:** We’ll work with you to provide expertise and guidance to help in your plans to bring your app from concept to reality, including:

* An all-expenses paid, working session with a panel of experts at Google HQ in Mountain View, CA
* Google engineer mentorship at the bootcamp, providing guidance and technical expertise on how to help your plans to bring your app to fruition

**Exposure and street cred!** Once your idea is ready for prime-time, we’ll help you get users, and celebrate you to the broader Android community, including:

* A collection on Google Play where we’ll feature your app (apps must be ready for Google Play on May 1, and must meet Google’s minimum quality requirements)
* Tickets to Google I/O 2020
* And we’ll celebrate these experiences to the broader Android developer community on developers.android.com. We might even showcase you at Google I/O, in places like the sandbox, sessions, perhaps even a keynote!

Helpful innovation is an important investment area for us on the Android team, and On-Device Machine Learning has played a critical role in powering new features in the last several releases of Android. We’re just beginning to scratch the surface, and we can’t wait to see what you come up with!
