# SponsorMe

*SponsorMe* is a project to help provide access to digital tools for learning, powered by on-device machine learning, innovation and willingness, to those people that have limited access to technology due to demographics, disabilities, economy or other multiple reasons.

The idea is to sponsor a child, teenager, or a person with visual, hearing, physical, or speech impairments, 
by providing him or her access to digital learning tools that can be downloaded on a mobile device, like an  android smartphone or tablet, where she/he can have access to digital books, videos and tutorials that could provide access to learning. 

SponsorMe will be an open-source and free application available in Google Play Store or even inclusive pre-installed on new smartphones or tablets with access to Internet. This application will serve as a hub and communication tool between the sponsored person and the sponsor, were they can chat on line, have a video or audio call, leave a message, send an electronic gif, share tutorials, videos or electronic books available in a digital hub. The application will use On-device Machine Learning to help translate audio or text in real time, using features like Live Captions, so the sponsor and the sponsored could communicate no matter if they speak different languages.

SponsorMe application will be free of charge, but to make this project a reality it will need the help and collaboration not only from individuals but also from technology companies, and organizations that already have established programs that help people in need.


## Open Source

As mentioned above, this will remain as an open source project and will be an application free of charge. This application is implemented using the following technologies:
* Kotlin Programming Language
* Android Jetpack
* Kotlin Multiplatform
* ML Kit's On-device Translation API 
* Live Captions
* and more!
